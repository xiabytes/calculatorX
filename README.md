# Calculator X

Hi there! Welcome to **Calculator X**, a modern, minimalist calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s inspired by the iPhone calculator, with essential features like addition, subtraction, percentage calculation, and more! This is a perfect project for anyone learning JavaScript or looking for a handy tool.

## Features

- **All Basic Math**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage Function**: Quickly find percentages like `50% = 0.5`.
- **Delete Key**: Remove the last digit when you make a mistake.
- **AC Key**: Instantly clear the screen and reset the calculator.
- **Clean UI**: Sleek and simple design inspired by iOS calculators.
- **Fully Responsive**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why I Made This

I created Calculator X to enhance my JavaScript skills and design something practical. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and looks great, whether you’re using it for quick calculations or just admiring the design!
